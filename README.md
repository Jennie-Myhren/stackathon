A feed-forward neural network built in Brain.js that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant given computed data from a digitalized image of a fine needle aspirate(FNA) of a breast mass. The data, which describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image, come from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
